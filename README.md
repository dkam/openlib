# Openlib

This is a tiny client to the Open Library's [Books API](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/books). If this client doesn't meet your needs, try the other [Openlibrary client](https://github.com/jayfajardo/openlibrary).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'openlib'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install openlib

## Usage

```
> book = Openlib::Book.new(id: '9780316030571')
> book.title
=> "Cryptonomicon"
> book.authors

```

You can query via ISBN, OCLC, LCCN or Openlibrary's OLID.
